But don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;re here to help! In this article, we&#8217;ll cover the basics of property assessment, including what it is, how it&#8217;s assessed, and what affects it. We&#8217;ll also share some tips on how you can improve your home&#8217;s appraisal value on the market.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What is Property Assessment?<\/strong><br \/>Property assessment is the process through which a government agency determines the fair market value (FMV) of a property. The FMV is used as the basis for property taxation.<\/li>\n<li><strong>How Is Property Assessment Assessed?<\/strong><br \/>There are two main ways that property assessment is done in Canada: by market analysis and by an approach called full-value accounting. The market analysis uses data from sales records to determine the current FMV of a property. Full value accounting uses an estimation model to calculate an FMV for a hypothetical buyer who would purchase the property at its current state. The difference between these two methods is often small, but it can have a significant impact on the final appraisal value calculation.<\/li>\n<li><strong>What Affects Property Assessment?<\/strong><br \/>The type of ownership \u2013 owner-occupied or investor-owned \u2013 and whether or not there are any liens against the property will affect how much consideration is given to factors such as age, condition, and location when calculating an FMV. The size and layout of the lot also play a role; larger lots typically command higher prices than smaller lots do.

There are a few things you can do to boost your home\u2019s value, including having an experienced real estate agent help prepare your home for sale, staging it well and taking advantage of tax exemptions.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most effective ways to increase the value of your home is by having an appraisal done. Appraisers use a variety of methods to come up with an estimate of a property\u2019s worth, including analyzing comparable sales in the area and using proven valuation techniques. Having a professional appraisal can add thousands of dollars to the price your home sells for and is definitely something you should consider if you are thinking about selling in the near future.<\/p>\n<p>Another way to boost the value of your home is by taking advantage of tax exemptions that may be available to you. For example, if you have lived in your property for at least two years before putting it on the market, there may be tax breaks available that could increase its appraised value. It is important to consult with a knowledgeable real estate agent who can help identify these exemptions so that you can take advantage of them.<\/p>\n<p>By taking these simple steps, you can significantly increase the value of your home when it comes time to sell it \u2013 making sure that you have all of the information necessary in order to make an informed decision is essential.<\/p>\n<h2>How to get your home appraisal value increased on the market<\/h2>\n<p>There are a few things you can do to increase the value of your home on the market.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Get new updates and repairs done:<\/strong> Updating your home\u2019s exterior and interior can add value to your property. Adding new features like a swimming pool or updated landscaping can also help improve curb appeal. If you have recently undergone major renovations, be sure to document everything in great detail so potential buyers can see for themselves how much work went into upgrading your home.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Make it ready for sale:<\/strong> Make it easy for buyers by tidying up and staging your home before putting it on the market. Clear away clutter, remove old furniture and replace it with fresh pieces that match the style of your home, and brighten up any dull areas with fresh paint or new wallpaper. If you have children, consider removing all toys and games from the living room and replacing them with family portraits or calming plants. This will make your house feel more spacious and inviting to potential buyers who may be intimidated by clutter.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Price it right:<\/strong> The key to maximizing the value of your home is always to price it correctly \u2013 below what you think is fair but above what you could potentially get if you put the property up for sale \u201cas is\u201d without any enhancements. By pricing below what you think is a fair asking price, you may be able to attract interested buyers without having to make too many concessions such as reducing the size of the down payment or making other changes to your contract. Conversely, if you price your home too high, you may end up not getting any offers at all, or having to accept a lower offer than you wanted. It\u2019s important to have an accurate estimate of what your home is worth based on recent market trends and local pricing data.

Additionally, app-based appraisals tend to be more accurate than traditional appraisals because they take into account recent sales data.\r\n\r\nAnother trend that\u2019s shaping the future of home appraisals is the growing importance of location. Many buyers and sellers are looking for properties in popular neighborhoods or areas with good schools. Savvy appraisers can capitalize on this trend by providing clients with detailed reports based on specific geographical areas.
